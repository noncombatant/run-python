# Run Python

This package contains a handy Python script I use to make it easier to run
Python interactively, by importing lots of stuff I commonly use and giving the
modules shorter names.

This also makes it convenient to use as a macOS Service and Automator Workflow,
which I then bind to a global hotkey. That allows me to evaluate the current
text selection as Python, anywhere in macOS, and have the value replace the
selection. Very handy.

To install on macOS, just run

```
% ./install.sh
```
